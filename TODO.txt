Things To Do:
add xml functionality to main application

change shader files based on stl file itself, no fixed shaders.

Remove Slic3r Dependency
add image segmentation
Make scripting engine and create example for XML output
Ensure that overall architechture is kept up to standard and that it will allow for scalibility of features

-For architechture, each machine will have a list of different processes which are dictated by the scripting engine

IMPORTANT:
scaling of part slices in PaintEngine area and useful IS A MUST

having 2D build area in PaintEngine is a must

PROBLEMS:

bitmaps are being duplicated, layer 0 is producing 14000 bitmaps for some reason
Rastering at a certain sequence of layers or layer k
scaling of part in build space is off
